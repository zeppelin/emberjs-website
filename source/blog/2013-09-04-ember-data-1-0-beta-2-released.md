[Ember Data 1.0.0-beta.2][1] has been released.

The release fixes a number of bugs, and adds several new features:

* Fix a number of issues where the code still expected class names
  (`App.Post`) instead of module-friendly shorthand (`post`).
* Add `host` and `namespace` in the `RESTAdapter`
* Add `record.rollback()`
* Add support for `since` token from find all fetches
* Add `store.update(type, hash)` to update some, but not all attributes
* Improve subclassability of `RESTSerializer` and `RESTAdapter`
