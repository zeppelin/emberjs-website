Although most of our collaboration takes place on Github, IRC
(`#emberjs` on freenode.net), and our [Discourse site](http://discuss.emberjs.com/)
the [Ember.js Core Team](/team) meets privately every
Friday at 2pm EST/11am PST through Google Hangout for a weekly
discussion of all things Ember.

If you have a topic you'd like to see covered, contact your favorite
core team member and let them know!

### Query parameters
This has been [enabled by default](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/commit/4130e556132eabad11aa619092c8ea840ba4957b)
in beta and nightly builds. Check out [Query Parameters Guide](/guides/routing/query-params/)
for usage details.

### Keeping the train moving
In the last meeting we discussed why the release of 1.6 and 1.7.beta was delayed.
In this meeting we resolved to not delay releases just because we hope to include
a specific feature.
