Although most of our collaboration takes place on Github, IRC
(`#emberjs` on freenode.net), and our [Discourse site](http://discuss.emberjs.com/)
the [Ember.js Core Team](/team) meets privately every
Friday at 2pm EST/11am PST through Google Hangout for a weekly
discussion of all things Ember.

If you have a topic you'd like to see covered, contact your favorite
core team member and let them know!

### Face to Face July 2014
Last week the core team (and those on path to core) met in New York City for
our periodic face to face meeting. Tom and Yehuda will be posting notes from
that meeting in the coming weeks. Thank you to our friends at [Pivotal
Labs](http://pivotallabs.com/) for hosting us in their awesome new office.

### Built With Ember
A few months ago we [began tracking](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZWYq3gwkPTzUiyqr4x_asSj8wIgfvg8XyLmU3Yx_FPE/edit) some of the ambitious apps made
with Ember.js. The folks at [Blimp](http://www.getblimp.com/) have turned that
document into a curated list of awesome Ember.js applications. [Check it
out](http://builtwithember.io/).

### ember-cli website
`ember-cli`, our ES6 module-based build tool has a new site. [Give it a
browse](http://www.ember-cli.com/)

### Modularizing Ember.js's Repository
We've started moving more external dependencies out of the Ember.js repository
and have begun work to turn some infrequently used parts of the framework into
their own libraries. These will still be built into the `1.x` series of
releases, but will not come bundled by default when we have the next major
versions release.
