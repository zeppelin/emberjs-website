Although most of our collaboration takes place on Github, IRC
(`#emberjs` on freenode.net), and our [Discourse site](http://discuss.emberjs.com/)
the [Ember.js Core Team](/team) meets privately every
Friday at 2pm EST/11am PST through Google Hangout for a weekly
discussion of all things Ember.

If you have a topic you'd like to see covered, contact your favorite
core team member and let them know!

### HTMLBars
Most of this weeks discussion focused on our largest ongoing project: HTMLBars.
We're hoping HTMLBars is on track to make it into the 1.9 or 1.10 beta series.

The biggest outstanding issues are general cleanup, fixing behavior around
parts of the
[DOM where a browser will "helpfully" insert "missing" tags](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/5571)
(like auto-insertion of `tbody` into a `table`),
and [Internet Explorer bugs and performance](https://github.com/tildeio/htmlbars/pull/91)
